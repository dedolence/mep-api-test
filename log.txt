To access the recipe ingredients via the dom after parsing with htmlparser2 would require hugely nested children.

Not a problem I guess.

But i'm thinking, if i'm going to just create a querySelectorAll that hunts down classes or text content that matches
the tags i'm looking for, why not just hunt for those during the parsing, instead of parsing, creating a dom, then traversing.

    wondering if there's any way to generalize these functions, but i don't think so. for instance, just extracting
    the <title> tag isn't so difficult (i have a generalized function for extracting specific tags from the DOM),
    but Allrecipes, for example, appends "Recipe | Allrecipes" to the end of their titles, so that requires a
    little extra formatting. so basically there's no real way around it if i want to produce clean results.

    ok but there's definitely a JSON object in the <head> that contains every bit of information i need, would
    require almost no parsing whatsoever, just JSON.parse()... what the fuck how am i just now realizing this.
    whatever.

    getting back into this. committed everything to main branch. this is a test to see that it merged correctly (i'm still a little unsteady on git).
